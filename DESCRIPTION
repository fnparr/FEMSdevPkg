Description: Exports a samplePortfolio( ) which reads designated csv files 
    with Bond portfolio and risk factor data, then creates and returns a 
    Portfolio object with this contents.  A Portfolio contains all necessary
    information to request an ACTUS server cashfkow event generation for its
    contracts using the designated scenario i.e. list of Risk factors. The 
    exported function generateEvents(<portfolio>, <ACTUS-serverURL>)  calls out
    to an ACTUS server to simulate the contracts of the portfolio using the risk
    factors in the portfoilio as context getting back a list of cashFlow event 
    one for each contract. The exported function EventSeries(<Contract>, 
    <risk-factor-list>, <ACTUS-serverURL> takes as input (1) a single ACTUS 
    contract, (2) a list of risk factors and an ACTUS server url. It generates 
    a portfolio containing this single contract then calls generateEvents( ) to
    have the designated ACTUS server simulate the contract cashflow events. The
    EventSeries saves the cashflow events of the input contract as a datafram 
    together with the contractID and its contract type. Exported function 
    cashflowPlot(<EventSerie>) generates a detailed graphical display of the 
    events in the input EventSeries. Exported utility function 
    installSampleData(<mydirectory>) copies samplecsv files with contract 
    definitions and risk factor date into a sesignated user directory as a model 
    for how to add data to be processed by these functions. Exported function
    runDadFiR3demo() starts a browser controlled shiny application showing plots 
    of some additional risk factor data. The underlying riskFactorindex data is 
    aslo available in the installSampledata directory.
    Version 1.0.1 includes capability to generate NominalValue reports for a 
    FInancialModel with a hierarchical tree of accounts, leaf accounts holding 
    ACTUS contracts. A Financial Model can generate expected cashvlows and 
    Value reports for multiple risk scenarios - each captured in a separate 
    ScenarioAnalysis. The Financial Model holds a set of ScenarioAnalyses  
    enabling comparison of results in different risk scenarios.
    Version 0.1.1 support NominalValue and Liquidity change reporting. 
    Version 0.1.2 adds account and contract Net Present Value Reporting
